		`Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and ... our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.`,
		`Dijkstra (1968) "A Case against the GO TO Statement" cited in: Bill Curtis (1981) Tutorial, human factors in software development. p. 109.`,

		`Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs`,

		`A convincing demonstration of correctness being impossible as long as the mechanism is regarded as a black box, our only hope lies in not regarding the mechanism as a black box.`,

		`When we take the position that it is not only the programmer's responsibility to produce a correct program but also to demonstrate its correctness in a convincing manner, then the above remarks have a profound influence on the programmer's activity: the object he has to produce must be usefully structured.`,
		`Dijkstra (1970) "Notes On Structured Programming" (EWD249), Section 3 ("On The Reliability of Mechanisms"), p.6.`,

		`The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.`,

		`Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!`,

		`The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.`,

		`Another two years later, in 1957, I married and Dutch marriage rites require you to state your profession and I stated that I was a programmer.But the municipal authorities of the town of Amsterdam did not accept it on the grounds that there was no such profession.And, believe it or not, but under the heading "profession" my marriage act shows the ridiculous entry "theoretical physicist"!`,

		`Automatic computers have now been with us for a quarter of a century.They have had a great impact on our society in their capacity of tools, but in that capacity their influence will be but a ripple on the surface of our culture, compared with the much more profound influence they will have in their capacity of intellectual challenge without precedent in the cultural history of mankind.`,
